<!--				<p>Developing a solution seemed important since even regular employees  find themselves taking stairs or elevators which don't go to the right floor.</p> -->
				<p>This app was made to help people trying to find their way through the labyrinth of the UW Medical Center. It uses an on-screen directional arrow to guide the visitor toward the right intersections, eventually leading to the entrance of <a href="http://ibic.washington.edu">Integrated Brain Imaging Center</a>.</p>
				<p>The app uses geolocation to detect one of the 4 entrances, calibrates the compass direction (hint: magnetic interference indoors, no GPS), and in some paths offers choices for using stairs or elevators.</p>

				<div class="box_common box1"><h1>Websites.</h1>
				<p>I have recently designed and implemented a <a href="http://ibic.washington.edu">website for Integrated Brain Imaging Center</a>. I've replaced as much Javascript as possible for CSS3 animations (some time-of-day dependent), modified a Google Calendar parser to display an Event Calendar at the conference room, and came up with a complementary <a href="http://ibic-uw.blogspot.com">IBIC's Blog</a> theme.</p>
<p>For <a href="http://ise.rutgers.edu">Rutgers Industrial & Systems Engineering Department</a>, I revised more than 400 static HTML pages with PHP-based navigation and  consistent CSS. The website serves 2,300 unique monthly visitors.</p>
<!--<p>I have dabbled in HTML since I was 12, staring with rich-text tags on ezboards, continuing with multi-page websites with <a href="http://i.imgur.com/gRzhBaO.png">lots of tables</a>, and currently having arrived at half-decent HTML5 beautified with CSS3+animations, and some simple PHP as backend.</p> -->

				<div class="box_common box1"><h1>Gaze Tracking Interface.</h1>
				<p>This was developed as my graduation project at <a href="http://www.mpei-festo.ru">MPEI-Festo</a>. I was already familiar with basic Computer Vision, so I took around 6 weeks to decide on the algorithm and implement it. The app used a laptop webcam to detect the user's gaze direction, then move the mouse pointer a set distance in the corresponding direction.</p>
				<p>I could left or right click by holding either of my eyes closed. Scrolling was done by looking up or down with the left eye while having the right eye shut.</p>

				<div class="box_common box1"><h1>Promo Material Design for Organization for Human Brain Mapping.</h1>
				<p>OHBM had the logo design finalized (the brain with Space Needle in the midline), and I was approached to design a promo poster with it. I redrew the logo on short notice, and quickly came up with the Seattle skyline theme.</p>
				<p>This design was printed on promo posters and used in conference events, presentations, and iOS+Android apps. The conference was visited by at least 2,500 scientists and students.</p>

				<p>I have worked on projects at the Integrated Brain Imaging Center incorporating data-driven approaches to quantifying the difference in neurofunctioning of people suffering from Alzheimer's compared to the healthy elderly, children experiencing Autism Spectrum Disorder compared the control group, as well as looking into novel signal localization and classification techniques.</p>

				<p>Provided software and hardware support for a small student group  running  Windows, Mac, and Ubuntu clients, as well as for 4 Dell PowerEdge servers with Ubuntu and Windows. Took care of data sharing, cross mounting, data security and storage redundancy.</p>
				<p>Every person had different research projects, which necessitated me to assist with installation and configuration of IDEs, MATLAB, IBM ILOG, FSL, ADNI on the servers. I also handled requests for software support, licensing, networking and remote connection issues.</p>
